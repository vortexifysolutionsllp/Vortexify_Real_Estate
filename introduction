Salesforce Real Estate CRM – Technical Repository
This repository contains the complete Salesforce codebase for the Real Estate CRM solution, built using Apex, Lightning Web Components (LWC), Flows, and Metadata configurations. 
It implements core real estate domain logic such as lead capture and assignment, project and unit inventory management, opportunity-to-booking conversion, broker/channel partner commission calculation, and post-sales processes.

The solution follows Salesforce best practices including trigger frameworks, bulk-safe Apex, reusable service layers, 
configuration-driven Flows, and modular LWCs, ensuring scalability, maintainability, and smooth deployments across environments.
